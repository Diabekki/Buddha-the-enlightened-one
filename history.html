        <h2 class="history-title">The story of Siddhartha</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Siddhartha Gautama known as the Buddha in his later years was born a prince into incredible wealth to Queen Maya 

            and King Suddhodana in Kosala, now modern-day North India 

            His story begins when mother Maya had a dream about a white elephant entering her womb before his birth and on her way to Evahrada she gave birth to him in the groove of Lumbini.  
        <br>
        <br>
            A seer by the name of Asita tells the king that Siddhartha will either follow in his father's footsteps and become king 

            or he will cast aside his aristocratic life in favour of becoming a monk depending on the young boy's upbringing. 

            Siddhartha's father fearing he would have no favoured heir decided to keep the prince away from the hardships of life  

            and gave him a lavish lifestyle filled with no despair and everything he could possibly want. He was married to Princess 

            Yasodhara at the age of 16 and together they had a son named Rahula.  

            But despite the king's efforts to protect his son he could not stop Siddhartha questioning his surroundings and noticed the ageing 

            individuals around him which made him question the worth of living such a rich lifestyle if he too will be subjected to old age and as a result of old age, death. 
        <br>
        <br>
            Siddhartha would venture outside of the palace for short bouts but never stray too far from the palace until one day, that was when 

            he saw so much suffering for the first time, people starving, the sick as well as the elderly, he had never felt such despair in his life 

            and decided at the age of 29 to abandon his rich life and live life as a wondering ascetic to see if he could find a solution to suffering. 

            Siddhartha was taught deep meditation by know teachers at the time name Alara Kamala and Uddaka Ramaputta,  

            he quickly reached the highest level of meditation but he still had not found a way to end suffering.  

            This realisation made Siddhartha retreat to jungle forests where he practiced extreme forms of meditation, he barely ate, and refrained from  

            moving as much as possible to have complete control over his body. 
        <br>
        <br>
            Six long years passed and by then Siddhartha was completely emaciated and extremely malnourished, he had still not found the meaning and  

            solution to suffering after all this time.  

            As Siddhartha sits with his companion, he overhears a minstrel discussing how to get the strings of his lute just right "the strings shouldn't be  

            loose or too tight, you have to have to find the middle ground for a good sound". Siddhartha became enthralled with the man's words  

            and remembered a time when he was young when he was cooling down beneath a tree, content without huge worry and decided to meditate  

            once again and realised it was not the lavish life or being the poorest brings you enlightenment, but living in the middle and learning to let go  

            is the way to liberate oneself from suffering.

            Siddhartha travels again without his companions as they don't know what to think of his new mindset, Siddhartha finally decides to reside under 

            a Bodhi tree where he sits in complete meditation. It is said in story's passed down that Mara "the evil one" attempts to fight Siddhartha with  

            bows and arrows so he does not reach enlightenment but Siddhartha's kindness turns the arrows to flowers. 

            Mara then sends his three daughters to seduce him but Siddhartha remains completely unfazed and separated from earthly desires. 

            Mara then desperate to understand how Siddhartha can ignore all his attempts asks him "Why do you think you have the right 

            to free yourself from suffering?"  

            Siddhartha touches the ground and asks the universe to witness his effort during his lifetimes, the universe shakes in acknowledgement  

            and Mara becomes defeated. 

            Siddhartha has now attained true enlightenment and is then known as the Buddha, his teachings will pass through many countries and touch the  

            lives of many for centuries to come.
