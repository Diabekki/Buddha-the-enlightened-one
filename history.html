            Buddhism is an ancient religion that began in Northeastern India more than 2,500 years ago. 
            It is based on the teachings of a Philosopher who roamed the earth 558 BCE. The original Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama,
            was a prince as he was born into an aristocratic family before he cast his riches aside to reach Nibbāna (Nirvana).
            In life he was a spiritual teacher and meditator who renounced the lavish lifestyle he inherited and travelled as a normal man. 
            Buddhism is now the fourth largest religion in the world with over 300 million people currently practicing its teachings.
            Modern Buddhism is a collection of teachings that were compiled by the Buddhist community and passed down through the centuries.
            these teachings include ‘The Five Precepts’ and ‘Chakras’ 
            which will be seen as we take a step towards learning the history of a renounced prince who found his calling.
