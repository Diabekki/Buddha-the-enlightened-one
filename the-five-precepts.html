                The first precept is a rule that can be found in almost every religion and states laws around the world. 
                This is the rule of not killing, in Buddhism this includes people and animals. 
                The precept ‘abstention from killing living beings’ has an accompanied virtue of kindness and compassion but
                also links to the modern rights of beings which is the ‘Right to Life’. 
                Buddhism has the view that living outside of these precepts will result in a rebirth in an unpleasant place.

                Abstention from theft is a rule that guides the person towards generosity and renunciation, 
                the goals of this precept were to try lessening the need for material possessions
                and to live a more fulfilled life based around their beliefs.

                Abstention from sexual misconduct is a rule that guides a follower towards a life of contentment,

                Abstention from falsehood teaches people to be honest and dependable.
                This precept includes lying but it was also intended to represent ‘wrong’ speech such as hate speech.

                Abstention from intoxication, this includes and is particularly focused on alcohol. 
                This precept was later introduced as a means of self-control 
                it was thought that this precept was one of the most important, 
                not because it had any direct benefit to a person but the indulgence in intoxicants was believed 
                to be the gateway to breaking the first four precepts.
