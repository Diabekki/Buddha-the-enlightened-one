## Features
This website features a sweet and easy way for beginners to learn about buddhism, 
the pages holding information are easy to read and retain. 
Many other websites while holding informtion tend to really try to focus on trying to teach while being very biased through flowery language, this website does not want to a push a decision on anyone but acts as a stepping stone if people want to find their own path.

 ## Testing

- I have conducted many tests to ensure the website works well, I have had to change the nav bar muliple times to make it sit properly which posed quite a challenge at first.

- I have checked the nav links work and bring the user to the right designated page.

- I have checked that all social media links are working fully and bring the user to the exact area specified.

- I have checked that the fixed background image on the home page does not stretch when scrolling.

- I have checked that the sign up form works and brings the user to the newsletter thank you page.

- I have checked the submit button css style works when clicking submit.

Getting the CSS to work perfectly proved to be a good learning curve as I had chosen not to use bootstrap to try challenge myself building everything from scratch.
